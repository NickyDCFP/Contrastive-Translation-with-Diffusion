# Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation, with Diffusion Models!

Heavily based on a [previous paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03117) that used GANs for the same task.

To use, download the AFHQ dataset (not v2) from [here](https://github.com/clovaai/stargan-v2/blob/master/README.md#animal-faces-hq-dataset-afhq). Put the `train` and `val` folders into `/dataset/misc/afhq256/` and run the appropriate command in `scripts/train.sh`!
